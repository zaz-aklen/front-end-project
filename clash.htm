        <h1>clash royale</h1>
<p><strong>Clash Royale</strong> is a tower rush video game which pits players in games featuring two or four players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective is to destroy the most opposing towers, with the destruction of the "King's Tower" being an instantaneous win.[8] After three minutes, if both of the players or both of the teams have an equal amount of crowns or none at all the match continues automatically onto overtime and the player who destroys an opposing tower wins instantaneously.[9] After overtime, a draw occurs. In a late 2018 update ditching the teammate in a 2v2 match multiple times caused the player to have a block that prevents him/her from playing 2v2 with random players for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>In Clash Royale, <em>players</em> are ranked by their number of trophies. Players level up by gaining Experience (or King Level) points through donating and upgrading cards. The highest possible level is level 13. The December 2018 Update added Star Points for excessive Experience when players reach level 13, and will award Star Points for previously leftover Experience.</p>

<p>Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles, a player wins a battle by destroying more towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower being represented as a 'crown'), or by destroying the opponent's King's Tower, resulting in an automatic "three-crown" victory (unless the King's Tower was destroyed at the same time by both players, resulting in a draw).</p>
